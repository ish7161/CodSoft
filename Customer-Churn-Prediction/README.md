# Customer Churn Prediction

The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning. Churn, in this context, refers to customers who are likely to stop using a product or service.

## Dataset

Dataset
The dataset used in the Customer Churn Prediction project contains information about customers and their interactions with a product or service. This data is crucial for building an effective churn prediction model. Below is an overview of the dataset:

Target Variable

Churn: A binary label indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Features

For the purpose of this project, we use various features extracted , some of them are :

1. Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer.
2. Gender: The gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female, Other).
3. Age: The age of the customer in years.
4. Tenure: The duration for which the customer has been using the product or service.

## Model

We employ a machine learning model to classify wheter a customer quits a service or not. The   algorithm used here are:

- **Random Forests**
- **Logistic Regression**


The model is trained using the training dataset and tuned to achieve the best possible performance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is available and properly formatted. 
5. Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
6. Train the model: Utilize a classification algorithm such as logistic regression or random forests to build the  model.
7. Evaluate the model: Use metrics such as precision, confusion matrix, and acurracy to assess the model's performance.
8. Make predictions: Deploy the trained model to make predictions.

Update the main script and documentation accordingly, incorporating any changes made during the development process.

## Evaluation

The performance of the Customer Churn Prediction model is evaluated using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Confusion Matrix**
