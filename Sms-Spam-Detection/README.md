# SMS Spam Detection

This repository contains a simple SMS spam detection system. The goal of this project is to identify whether a given SMS message is spam or not. The system is based on machine learning techniques and utilizes a dataset of labeled SMS messages for training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of SMS messages that are labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). This dataset is then split to a training set and a testing set, allowing us to train the model on one portion of the data and evaluate its performance on another.

## Features

For the purpose of this project, we use various features extracted from the SMS messages, which may include:

1. **Text content**: The actual text of the SMS message.
2. **Length of the message**: The number of characters or words in the message.
3. **Presence of specific keywords**: Certain keywords or phrases commonly found in spam messages.
4. **Punctuation and special characters**: The frequency of punctuation marks or unusual characters.
5. **Character casing**: Whether the message is written in all uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case.

## Model

We employ a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam. The  classification algorithm used here are:

- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**


The model is trained using the training dataset and tuned to achieve the best possible performance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is available and properly formatted. If needed, preprocess and normalize the data. Handle any class imbalance issues that may be present.
5. Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
6. Train the model: Utilize a classification algorithm such as logistic regression or random forests to build the fraud detection model.
7. Evaluate the model: Use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance. Consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling to address any class imbalance and further improve results.
8. Make predictions: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new credit card transactions and identify potential fraudulent activities.

Update the main script and documentation accordingly, incorporating any changes made during the development process.

## Evaluation

The performance of the SMS spam detection model is evaluated using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified messages.
- **Precision**: The proportion of messages classified as spam that are actually spam.
